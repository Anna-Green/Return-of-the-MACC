# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as team members pledge to making participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the group
- Showing empathy towards other team members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Wellbeing Guide
When stressed I need...(when Iâ€™m stressed ... I need...)
- Maria: when stressed I seem flustered, feel hot in face. I need a break from the screen, to walk around the room and talk to other people
- Anna: I need small breaks eg. walk, cuppa
- Caroline: I need a break to walk around and maybe go outside
- Claire: when stressed I will shut down a bit but will communicate if I need space

In general I need...(general needs eg. kids, illness, sleep etc)
- Maria: I get really tired sometimes and may need a 15min nap
- Anna: 
- Caroline: To feel positive and like things are moving in the right direction. also coffee
- Claire: Sleep, to take breaks when I'm feeling overwhelmed and get some space when I need. + coffee, first thing.. always. 

## Our Key Expectations
- We want to come out of this project feeling good, no matter how far we get technically
- Agreed hours of work: no late nights, work hours are between 9am(ish) until 7pm each day although team members are more than welcome to work outside those hours as long as this is communicated to the team with relevant details(what you will be working on, what branch etc)
  - Weekend hours: No late nights are expected from the team - no 15hr shifts! Maria will have family commitments for most of Sunday but will be available during late evening.
- Conflict within the group: If conflict arises, find the needs of both/all people involved and then clarify the requests to meet those needs (eg. If Maria has a need to contribute to the group via back-end code then she should put a request to the team/pair that she'd like to drive the pair until the first get route has been set up)
- Communication methods: Slack(during work hours) and txt(outside of work hours)

## Our Roles & Agile process
Decision making: When we discuss tasks we will look at consensus and if someones not happy, we sit down and go through it together. Becaused we are a team of four, there maybe situations where decisions are split 50-50, when this happens we will...have an outside person help weight pros and cons?

Roles are a mixed bag - everyone's going to be doing a bit of everything (eg. back-end, scrum, vibes, front-end)

Time-boxing will be crucial for our chatty vibes

## Our Survival Strategies
- Friday night outing!
- See the funny side of things
- Don't be afraid or disheartened by conflict, we are here for one another
- Eating together:
  - Maria: prefers lunches together
  - Anna:
  - Caroline: likes to eat together but also sometimes prefers to eat on her own
  - Claire: Communicate with everyone when we aren't on the same page & check in regularly.   

## Our Troubleshooting Strategies (How we get help)
Individually
- Technically:
Asking facilitators, console logging, asking other people in our cohort for help especially if it's something they previously did in a project
- Non-technically

- Claire: Yoga & meditation, go for a walk, get a break outside and talk things out. 
- Caroline: getting coffee and/or food, taking a walk, taking a break

As a Team
- Technically: After exhausting our own methods within the group (google, code examples, psuedocode etc), we will approach one of the facilitators for help
- Non-technically: Supporting each other as team members to take care of ourselves and our obligations outside EDA, encouraging each other to take breaks, eat, get enough sleep, etc. Also maybe doing meditation and yoga as a group
